Shaders by @johndaguerra , give me a follow if you're feeling it :)

HEY these are the ~plaid~ shaders, named after that part in monkey island where a guy's plaid shirt does exactly this effect.  There's probably a better name for it.



They pan / rotate a texture over screenspace instead of worldspace, so they move relative to the screen instead of the in-game camera.

-PlaidPan pans the texture
-PlaidRotate rotates the texture
-PlaidShaded is PlaidPan but with lighting on the object
-PlaidBound is some weird earthbound-esque effect that I made by accident while doing this.  I liked it.  Maybe you will too?



No credit needed.  Really though, follow me on twitter.  @johndaguerra.  I'm cool.
