Please note that the scenes require Unity Pro Image effects to work correctly.  However you can still use them in the free version as long as you are prepared to re-set up the lighting.  Before importing the package into you scene make sure that you have already imported the pro effects.

To get the scenes to look the same as in the screen shots the project settings must use linear color space and deffered rendering.

I could not get unity to export the water properly so users will have to add their own water mesh, which is relatively easy anyway.  Just add the unity4 water4 prefab and tweak the colors to suit.

I have included the scenes in a zip as unity would not let me add them to the package, please unzip them in the location of the zip file.

Thanks.
