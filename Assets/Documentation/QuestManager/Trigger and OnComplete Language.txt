The language follows English sentence order, however the words must be limited to:
actions: Get, Enter, Drop, Cut, Hit, Dig, Grind, Merge, Become
prepositions: On, With, And
object types: Player, Item ____, Location ____

Note: Get and Become are both actions, but they are to be used in On Complete functions. (However, Get can be used in trigger functions.)
The language can be edited to add more features.


At the moment, a sentence can have up to two objects (other than the player) or a location, and must contain an action.
Objects include all named objects in the game, and must follow the form “Item ObjectName” where ObjectName is the name of the object.


Actions fall into three categories: ones where two objects must be involved (with a word describing their interaction order); ones involving only one action; or one with a location only.
The current list of actions are “Get, Enter, Drop, Cut, Hit, Dig, Merge, Become, Open, Play”.
	Get - Player receives/picks up an item
		[Not Implemented] can be used to spawn an item in another location
		Ex: “Player Get Item PoundedRice”
	Enter - Player enters a particular area (must be specified by name)
		Ex: “Player Enter Winter”
	Drop - Player must cause an item to fall onto another item
		Ex: “Player Drop Item RiceInBowl On Item ActiveFire”
	Cut - Player must cause a cutting motion with one object on another
		Ex: “Player Cut Item Bread With Item Knife”
	Hit - Player must cause a hitting motion (e.g. with a hammer)
		Ex: "Player Hit Item SteamedRice With Item Hammer"
	Dig - Player must cause a digging motion (e.g. with shovel)
		Ex: “Player Dig Location RiceField With Item Shovel”
	Merge - Player must bring two items close together, while holding both of them
		Ex: “Player Merge Item MultiTool And Item Shovel”
	Become - One item transforms into another (to be used in OnComplete)
		Ex: “Item Rice Become Item CookedRice”
	Open - Player opens something (atm primarily meant for inventory)
		Ex: "Player Open Item Inventory"
	Play - UI plays an action (to be used in OnComplete)
		Ex: "UI Play Sound SoundName" or "UI Play Dialog DialogName"
	Leave - Allows the player to leave an item in one season, to pick it up X seasons later
		Ex: "Player Leave Item ItemName For 2 Seasons"

Note: Tasks are not required to have Trigger functions, as such, in the event that one would like to combine multiple OnComplete functions, simply create new tasks without triggers, and set their subtasks to be one of the tasks that contains the other OnComplete event you want.
Children cannot have multiple parents. There is no check for this at the moment, so try to avoid this.


Objects are typically separated by prepositions; these describe the order in which they are interacting in.
The current list of prepositions are “On, With, And”
	With -	Interact an object WITH a tool
		target WITH source
		EX: “Cut Item Tree With Item Axe”
	On - 	Interact an tool ON an object
		source ON target
		EX: “Drop Item Water On Item ActiveFire”
	And -	Interact two objects equally
		object AND object
		EX: “Merge Item Stick And Item Tape”



The term object1 will often refer to source objects, AKA tools. They are not necessarily the first object in a sentence.
The term object2 will refer to the target object (which are NOT tools). They are not necessarily the second object in a sentence.
