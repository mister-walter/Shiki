General Guidelines:
Everything is case sensitive.
TOML works on a key-value pair system. Multiple pairs can be grouped together under tables, which are symbolized by [TableName].
In order to have multiple tables with the same name, they must be placed in a table array, symbolized by [[TableArrayName]].

The TOML parser I have used will not accept key names that begin with lowercase letters (who knows why). 
Ex:	Key = “Value” is ok
	key = “Value” is NOT ok; it will not recognize “key” as being a key

The location of the TOML files are Assets > StateFiles

Comments can be written in TOML with #.


quest_list.tml:
Contains all of the individual tasks for any quest.
The order in which tasks are written does not matter. 
Quests are definied as a series of tasks, represented as a tree, where each task can have child tasks. Tasks must have names Before a task can be completed, its child tasks must be completed. Once the child tasks are completed, if a task has a trigger function, it must be able to return true give the player’s circumstances/actions. If the trigger function returns true, the OnComplete function will then be called.

A typical task will take the following format:

[[task]]
Name = “NameHere”
SubTask = “SubTaskName1 SubTaskName2”
Trigger = “Trigger Function Goes Here”
OnComplete = “OnComplete Function Goes Here”

Example:
[[task]]
Name = "PoundRice"
SubTask = "SteamRice"
Trigger = "Player Hit Item SteamedRice With Item Hammer"
OnComplete = "Player Get Item PoundedRice"

The only necessary parameters are the initial “[[task]]” (each new task must begin with this) and the name. All other parameters can be omitted.
Example:
[[task]]
Name = "GetBowl"
Trigger = "Player Get Item Bowl"

There is additionally a TriggerRepeat parameter. If this parameter is given, it should be a positive integer (in a string).
When TriggerRepeat is set, it means that the task will not be considered complete until Trigger has been satisfied that number of times.
For example, the following task would only be considered complete when the player has opened their inventory 3 times:
[[task]]
Name = "OpenInventoryThrice"
Trigger = "Player Open Inventory"
TriggerRepeat = "3"


quest_status.tml:
At the moment contains one player’s status through quests. Code can be edited later to support multiple player’s save states.
Contains the list of names for CompletedTasks for one player in string form.
Example:
CompletedTask = “PoundRice SteamRice GetBowl” # Example is not logically sound
